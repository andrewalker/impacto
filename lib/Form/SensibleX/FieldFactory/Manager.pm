=head1 NAME

Form::SensibleX::FieldFactory::Manager - Manage field factories

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When building a Form::Sensible form object, and having complex field factories
(classes which generate one or more fields, and handle their communication with
the database), this is their manager. It has pointer to each one of them, and
is able to apply them to the form in the end. It's supposed to be used by
L<Form::SensibleX::FormFactory>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_factories_to_form

Run through all the factories in memory and call L</add_factory_to_form> on
them, to apply them on the form.

=head2 add_factory_to_form

Add one factory to the form.

=head2 init_factory

When adding a new instance to a factory class, if it's the first time this
class has been seen, it must be initialized with this method.

=head2 add_to_factory

Add new instance to an initialized factory class, or initialize a new one.

=head2 _replace_fields

=head2 _fix_definition_and_get_class_name
