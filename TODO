    - ** Select's with more than one field in the label **
        - write tests!
    - Decide what to do with IC::Finance::InstallmentPayment (due, ledger)

          MIME::Base64::encode_base64url('2000-02-02 00:00:00 @#$% Deus me ama @#$% Loja')
        - subforms would fix it. maybe this is still interesting?

    - subclass FileSelector -> bytea -> display image when editing
    - many_to_many
    - record_meta
      -- gotta think about a better naming!

    - subforms!

    - Further customizations on controllers
    - Create a page to manage users
    - Create a page for user's settings
